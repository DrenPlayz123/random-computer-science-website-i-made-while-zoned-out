      Lalala, time to use my Windows/Mac/Chrome/etc computer! …Oh! Would you look at that? There’s so much bloat, I have no privacy, and I can barely customize anything.
      If only there was a super lightweight OS that had way more features, was completely customizable, was open
      source, etc, and had NO bloat at all! Oh wait, there is! It’s called Linux.
    </p>

      <h2>Linux</h2>
      <p>
        Linux is an open source OS (operating system) that has been contributed to by over 15,000 developers.
        It’s lightweight, completely customizable, and has no bloat. Anyone can learn Linux if they pick a good
        distro. Don’t know what distros are?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="linux-section">
      <h2>Distros</h2>
      <p>
        Linux is well suited for anyone. From computer nerds to people who actually touch grass, there’s a distro
        for you! Linux distros (distributions) are basically different versions of Linux, except they’re not like
        updates. Think of it like video games. You buy a game, then you realize it’s too hard for you. You buy the
        sequel of the game, and get good at that game’s sequel. Except, Linux distros are free. Don’t know what
        distro to start with?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Picking a good distro</h2>
    <p>
      There are many Linux distros suited for different types of people. Whether it be Mint, Ubuntu, or Zorin,
      you should find a distro you’re comfortable with. Some good beginner distros are:
    </p>

    <ul class="distro-list">
      <li>Mint (Mint Cinnamon Edition if you want eye candy.)</li>
      <li>Ubuntu</li>
      <li>Zorin</li>
      <li>MX Linux</li>
      <li>Pop! (Pop! excels at gaming performance a bit more than other distros.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are just my recommendations. You can, of course, pick any beginner friendly distro out there. 
      What’s important is that you pick a distro you find comfortable! (TIP: Do NOT jump straight into a distro like Arch or Gentoo. Make sure to pick a beginner friendly distro. A distro you're comfortable with!)
    </p>

    <h2>So, what makes Linux the best</h2>
    <p>
      Linux is the best OS because it can do anything. For free. It’s the most customizable OS out there.
      Linux is also the most secure OS, with tons of security features built into it. Linux will practically
      wipe any virus before you can blink. Also, unlike Windows, it doesn’t read or track anything you do.
      Any personal information you enter? That stays with you. Not your computer. As well, Linux is lightweight.
      Due to Linux’s lightweightness and lack of bloat, it can run on very low end devices, so even if you have
      a poor machine, you can still make the switch! On Linux, I use 4GB of ram watching YouTube. While on Windows,
      I use 11GB of ram watching YouTube. These are just a few of the many reasons to switch to Linux!
